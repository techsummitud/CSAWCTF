Dissasembly in Ida Pro reveals 

fld     ds:dbl_8048690
fstp    qword ptr [esp+98h]

fld instructions set ST(0) with address from 0x8048690
fstp instructions populates $esp+0x98 with ST(0)

At 0x8048690 the FP 64.33333 is stored, which in binary is \xa5\x31\x5a\x47\x55\x15\x50\x40.

When putting text in the buffer, need to populate $esp+0x98 with correct FP so that jp doesnt jump to exit syscall but rather to leave ret.

So if we set ret_addr to some address in memory we would like to jump to, and send 

'a' 128 times + float + 'abcdefgh' + ebp_addr + ret_addr

we would jump to that address. If we set ret_addr to beginning of buffer, which is displayed on stdout, eip gets set to beginning of 'a' sequence.

Use shell script adapted from http://blog.init-labs.org/2015/09/22/csaw-pwn-100-write-up, in this directory

Disable aslr address randomization

echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

Run binary a couple times to verify Buf address is the same throughout multiple runs. Modify buf address in little-endian notation in shell.py file.
